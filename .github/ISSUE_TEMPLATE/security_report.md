**Do NOT include sensitive data in public issues.**

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. Prefer encrypted email: send details to **security@controluniversal.dev** (PGP support: provide PGP public key in your message if you want a secure reply).
2. If email isn't possible, open a new GitHub issue and add the `security` label, then mark it `private`/`confidential` by requesting maintainers to restrict visibility (or open the issue and immediately add a note asking for a private disclosure via email).
3. Include: steps to reproduce, impact, affected versions, and suggested mitigation.

Maintainers will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and work with you to triage and fix the issue. Thank you for responsibly disclosing security problems.
