# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include harassment, trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and other actions that reasonably make others feel unwelcome.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by contacting the project maintainers at **conduct@controluniversal.dev**. All reports will be handled with discretion and will remain confidential to the extent possible.

**Security issues:** for vulnerabilities or sensitive security reports, please contact **security@controluniversal.dev** (prefer encrypted email — add your PGP public key for a secure reply) instead of opening a public issue. If email is not possible, open a GitHub issue and add the `security` label and a short notice asking maintainers to handle disclosure privately.

If the above email is not appropriate for you, you may also open a private issue on GitHub and add the label `confidential` (maintainers will handle it privately).

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing the code of conduct. We may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant v2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/). Please replace `conduct@controluniversal.dev` with an appropriate contact address where reports should be sent if needed.
