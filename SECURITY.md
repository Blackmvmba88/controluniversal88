Security policy

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly so we can address it quickly and keep users safe.

Reporting
- Preferred: **email**: security@controluniversal.dev — if possible **PGP-encrypt** your message and include steps to reproduce, affected versions, and proof-of-concept code.
- Alternative: open a GitHub issue and add the `security` label, but do not include secrets or PII in public issues.

PGP
- If you want to send encrypted details, reply with your PGP public key, and maintainers will provide an encryption key or use the public key you supplied.

Maintainers' PGP public key

If maintainers publish an ASCII-armored PGP public key it will be linked here and available in `SECURITY_PGP.md` for download and usage instructions. See `SECURITY_PGP.md` for example commands to encrypt a report using `gpg`.

Response
- We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide a timeline for remediation.

Credits
- If you prefer, you may request that we add you to the release notes or `SECURITY.md` credits after the issue is fixed; this is optional and handled case-by-case.
